<p>Albert Einstein (1879–1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist who revolutionized science with the theory of relativity (\(E=mc^{2}\)) and the photoelectric effect (1921 Nobel Prize). Known for his profound contributions to quantum theory and cosmology, he worked in a patent office before becoming a renowned professor in Europe and the US. He was a passionate pacifist and humanitarian who emigrated to the US in 1933. </p>

                    We can say without any doubt that Albert Einstein was one of the greatest scientists
                    in history. He was curious, imaginative, and deeply intelligent. From a young age,
                    he showed interest in mathematics and physics. His ideas changed the way we understand
                    space, time, energy, and the universe itself.

                <p>
                    Einstein worked as a patent clerk before becoming a famous scientist. Despite facing
                    many challenges, he continued to question traditional ideas and developed revolutionary
                    theories. His work still influences modern science and technology today.
